    "Managing Resources : In any programming language, the usage of resources like file operations or database connections is very common. But these resources are limited in supply. Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage. If they are not released then it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash. It would be very helpful if user have a mechanism for the automatic setup and teardown of resources.In Python, it can be achieved by the usage of context managers which facilitate the proper handling of resources. The most common way of performing file operations is by using the with keyword as shown below:"
